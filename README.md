# Project Description

The server-side component of the Cipriana Coquia Memorial Dialysis Kidney Center (CCMDKC) system is designed to support secure, efficient, and scalable administrative operations. It manages core backend functionalities such as user authentication, role-based access control, patient data management, appointment handling, and API services that enable seamless communication with the frontend application.

Built to ensure data integrity and security, the server processes requests, manages database operations, and implements business logic that supports administrative workflows. Its structured and maintainable architecture ensures reliable performance and scalability, making it suitable for handling sensitive healthcare data and supporting growing system demands.
